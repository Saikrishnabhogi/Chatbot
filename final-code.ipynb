It primarily affects the lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body, such as the brain, kidneys, and spine. TB is an infectious disease that can be transmitted through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and it can also be spread through close contact with someone who has the infection. Symptoms of TB can include coughing, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. If left untreated, TB can lead to serious complications, such as lung damage, respiratory failure, and kidney disease.\n\nHowever, if treated promptly with antibiotics, most people with TB can recover fully, and treatment can prevent the spread of the infection to others.
